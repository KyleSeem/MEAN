Assignment: Evolving Syntax

One of the great things about Internet technologies is the pace of change. People are constantly improving things, and that's especially prevalent in the JavaScript community, where even the interpreters for JavaScript are evolving. The current evolution of JavaScript is called ES6 (formally ECMAScript 2015).

Refactor some of your existing assignments using ES6 syntax, such as abbreviated function calls:

    "use strict" // you may (some interpreters do, some don't) require this statement before ES2015 is used.
    var myVariable = () => { console.log('hello'); }
    myVariable();

Important syntax changes:
    * abbreviated function calls
    * classes
    * promises
    * generators
