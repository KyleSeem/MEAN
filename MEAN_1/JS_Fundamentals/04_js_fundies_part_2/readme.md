Assignment: JS Fundamentals Part II

1. Turn the following problems from JS Fundamentals Part I into functions that take variable inputs:
    * Create a simple for loop that sums all the integers between x and y (inclusive). Have it console log the final sum.
    * Write a loop that will go through an array, find the minimum value, and then return it
    * Write a loop that will go through an array, find the average of all of the values, and then return it

2. Rewrite these 3 as anonymous functions assigned to variables.

3. Rewrite these as methods of an object

4. Create a JavaScript object called person with the following properties/methods
    Properties
        * name - set this as your own name
        * distance_traveled - set this initially as zero
    Methods
        * say_name - should alert the object’s name property
        * say_something - have it accept a parameter. This function should then say for example “{{your name}} says ‘I am cool’” if you pass ‘I am cool’ as an argument to this method.
        * walk - have it alert for example “{{your name}} is walking” and increase distance_traveled by 3
        * run - have it alert for example “{{your name}} is running” and increase distance_traveled by 10
        * crawl - have it alert for example “{{your name}} is crawling” and increase distance_traveled by 1
        
What should your methods return?
